# Questions
## Server side Framework
It uses Node JS and Express JS as server side framework. Express is the most common Node JS web application framework that deals with exploring various code  which we need on a frequent basis like POST body / query string parsing. Express JS basically helps you manage everything, from routes, to handling requests and views.

##Client side Framework
It uses Angular JS as client side framework. Angular JS has better data binding, DOM manipulation and it is light and very clean and involves simple manipulations.Good frameworks can help architect our code so that it is modular (therefore reusable), DRY, readable, performant and secure. 

##Other components installed
For running locally it requires a mongodb for running mongod command in background. It uses heroku mongolab db for storing the documents. Refer heroku mongolab documention to connect to the database and importing data from the csv or json file.

### What aspect of the implementation did you find easy, if any, and why?
Implementing Angular JS was relatively easy because I have experience with javascript. Also, as this was covered in project 1, it was pretty easy to figure out and understand the implementation. So, learning and implementing Angular JS was simple.

Along with this, implementation of Node JS was also easy because of project 1 and therefore, there was time to further understand the concepts of node JS.
### What aspect of the implementation did you find hard, if any, and why?
Connecting with MongoDb was difficult for me. But later I figured it out.
### If you were to use these technologies professionally, what would be your biggest concern?
One of the biggest concern will be less control of the application while using heroku server. Along with this, security and speed are other big concerns.
